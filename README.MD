# ðŸŽ¨ Matplotlib Visuals

This repository contains my practice with **Matplotlib**, a Python library for creating data visualizations.  
I am learning step by step and adding different types of plots as I progress.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside
- Basic line plots  
- Bar charts  
- Scatter plots  
- Histograms  
- Pie charts  

(More plots will be added as I learn!)
